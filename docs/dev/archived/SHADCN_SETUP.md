# Shadcn + Lucide Setup (Quick Start)

This project uses Tailwind + Vite + React and includes local `ui` components that mimic shadcn styles. To integrate the official shadcn components and Lucide icons, follow these steps:

1. Install Lucide & shadcn CLI (if not already installed)

```powershell
pnpm add -D lucide-react
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init --client vscode
```

2. Add the shadcn components/blocks you want (example):

```powershell
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @shadcn/sidebar-01 @shadcn/sidebar-07 @shadcn/dashboard-01 @shadcn/navigation-menu @shadcn/avatar @shadcn/button
```

This will copy those components into your project (typically into a `registry` or `components` folder) and add any required package dependencies.

3. Replace the local temporary `Button` and `Avatar` if you want to use the official ones generated by shadcn:

```tsx
// Example: replacing local Button with shadcn's button (path depends on CLI setup)
// import Button from "@/registry/ui/button/button";
// import Avatar from "@/registry/ui/avatar/avatar";
```

4. Start the dev server

```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Notes:

- The shadcn CLI will prompt you for file copy locations; choose the renderer path: `src/renderer`.
- If you used the `--install` flag, dependencies like `lucide-react` will be added automatically (otherwise install them manually).
- The project already includes a basic layout in `src/renderer/components/layout`. After running the CLI, feel free to recompose components using shadcn ones.

If you want me to run the shadcn add commands and wire the generated components into the layout, tell me and I can apply the changes and update imports accordingly.
